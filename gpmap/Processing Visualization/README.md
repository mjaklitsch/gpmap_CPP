This visualization was created in two days to ensure that the assumptions I was making based on the specifications were correct. 
This was not built to be maintained, nor was it built to be elegant or understandable. This was built quickly and harshly to 
prepare to do the work in C++ where a visualization would not be implemented. The C++ script should be referenced for any questions 
regarding the actual algorithm's implementation.
